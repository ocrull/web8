    <h1>Me</h1>
    <h2>This website will tell you about my interests, my life, my classes, and little bit about gymnastics.</h2>
    <p class="me">I'm 14 years old and I live in Seattle, WA. I have a younger sister and she's 11 years old. I have two cats, their names are Cleo and Fernando. Cleo is four years old and grey. Fernando is 15 years old and also grey. My favorite color is pink. I love to do gymnastics and have been doing it for nine years. My favorite events are the floor and bars. I compete level 7 last year, and I got to go to region 2 regionals. It was so fun and I got to make friends with people from across the US. I also love to ski in the winter. I ski at Crystal Mountain, and my favorite run is O-medows. I also love traveling. Some of my favorite places to travel are Hawaii, the coast in Massachusetts, and Paris. I love to go to the beach and snorkel in Hawaii. My favorite thing to do in Massachusetts is going on the boat, and in Paris, I love to try all the different restaurants and bakeries. </p>
